This is my first project for the programming logic course in the systems development analysis course. The idea was to develop a simple system for a coffee shop that simulates the functionality of a customer service management system for product and customer registration, as well as discount points system. It would be intuitive and inclusive for employees with little or no familiarity with this type of system.
